# MVCMultiLayerProject
This is a N-Tier layered blog project that i made with .NET MVC.
I made this project with the things that i learned from Murat Yücedağ's "MVC Proje Kampı" course videos (via: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnjBHu2xXNNQJehhCg--CzQQMHXTsFAb ).
I got help from https://adminlte.io/themes/v3/ for the admin panel view pages that i made for this project.
